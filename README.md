# LeJia #

LeJia is a driving assistant based on speech recognition. 

### What is LeJia? ###

You can use it to view the map or navigate. It provides the function of online booking refueling, online music, vehicle information management and traffic violation inquiries. Most importantly, you can do this through voice interaction. Unfortunately it is a semi-finished product.
